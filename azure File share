1. Storage Account Limits Resource		   Standard Limit		                 		  Notes
Max file shares per storage account		Unlimited (GPv2)						Reference
Max capacity per storage account		5 PiB (with large file shares enabled)	                     Default is 100 TiB
Max ingress/egress bandwidth			50 Gbps (LRS/ZRS)					     Depends on redundancy


2. File Share Limits
Resource								Premium (SSD)				Standard (Hot/Cool)
Max share size							100 TiB					100 TiB (large file shares enabled)
Default max share size					        5 TiB					5 TiB (can be increased)
Max file size							4 TiB					4 TiB
Max IOPS per share						Up to 100,000			        1,000 IOPS + burst up to 3,000
Max throughput per share				       Up to 10,240 MiB/s		        Up to 60 MiB/s
Max open handles per file				       2,000					2,000


1. SMB Limits
	Max concurrent connections: 2,000 (Premium), 1,000 (Standard)
	Max open files per share: 25,000
	Supports SMB Multichannel (Premium only)

2. NFS (v4.1) Limits
	Max concurrent connections: 1,000
	Max open files per share: 25,000

3. Performance Considerations
	Premium file shares: Consistent low-latency, high IOPS
	Standard file shares: Burstable performance (scales with size)



Enable large file shares if >5 TiB is needed.
Use Premium tier for high IOPS/low latency workloads.
Monitor metrics (IOPS, throughput, latency).
Enable snapshots for backup & recovery.
Use Azure File Sync for hybrid cloud caching.
